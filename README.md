# Overview

This is a game I created in Python using the Arcade module called "Monster Horde." The object is to kill as many monsters as possible before running out of health. The more monsters a player kills, the more points they earn. When the player runs out of health, the game ends.

My purpose in writing this program was to learn how to develop a game in Python on my own, practice designing sprites for a game, and to learn how to work with features I am unfamiliar with (such as building a GUI).
